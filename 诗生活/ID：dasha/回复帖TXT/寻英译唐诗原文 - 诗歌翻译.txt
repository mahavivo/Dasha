寻英译唐诗原文作者似是茶圣陆羽，但我一时找不到原文，坛上诸君如有兴趣也来trace一trace。



THE WILD FLOWER MAN 



By Lu Yu

trans. Kenneth Rexroth



Do you know the old man who 

Sells flowers by the South Gate? 

He lives on flowers like a bee. 

In the morning he sells mallows, 

In the evening he has poppies. 

His shanty roof lets in the 

Blue sky. His rice bin is 

Always empty. When he has 

Made enough money from his 

Flowers, he heads for a teahouse. 

When his money is gone, he 

Gathers some more flowers. 

All the spring weather, while the 

Flowers are in bloom, he is 

In bloom, too. Every day he 

Is drunk all day long. What does 

He care if new laws are posted 

At the Emperor's palace? 

What does it matter to him 

If the government is built 

On sand? If you try to talk 

To him, he won't answer but 

Only gives you a drunken 

Smile from under his tousled hair.

放翁《剑南诗稿》卷二十三：城南上原陈翁以卖花为业得钱悉供酒资又不能独饮逢人辄强与共醉辛亥九月十二日偶过其门访之败屋一间妻子饥寒而此翁已大醉矣殆隐者也为赋一诗原题：



城南上原陈翁以卖花为业得钱悉供酒资又不能独饮逢人辄强与共醉辛亥九月十二日偶过其门访之败屋一间妻子饥寒而此翁已大醉矣殆隐者也为赋一诗



正文：



君不见会稽城南卖花翁

以花为粮如蜜蜂

朝卖一株紫

暮卖一枝红

屋破见青天

盎中米常空

卖花得钱送酒家

取酒尽时还卖花

春春花开岂有极

日日我醉终无涯

亦不知天子殿前宣白麻

亦不知相公门前筑堤沙

客来与语不能答

但见醉发覆面垂髿髿



集部,別集類,南宋建炎至德祐,劍南詩藁,卷二十三



Dasha按：最后一句“但见醉发覆面垂髿髿”，网上文字往往脱漏“髿髿”字。髿，shā，所加切，平，麻韵；苏禾切，平，戈韵。也作“髟[上]少[下]”，陆游此处意为“发下垂貌”。是以谨附“四库”光盘截图。

厉害!多谢DASHA兄。我被Philip Levine误导了，尽往〈全唐诗〉里找，白费劲。
