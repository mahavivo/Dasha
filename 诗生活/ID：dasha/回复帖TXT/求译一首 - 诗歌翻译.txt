求译一首              Song   
      Why fadest thou in death ,
        Oh yellow waning tree?
      Gentle is autumn's breath,
        And green the oak by thee.
  
      But with each wind that sighs 
        The leaves from thee take wings;
      And bare thy branches rise 
        Above their drifted ring.
                            
                               R.W.Dixon

问候小末老师，坛中英语高手众多，Dasha就不掺和啦，帮顶。Richard Watson Dixon<p><b>Richard Watson Dixon</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_5" title="May 5">May 5</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1833" title="1833">1833</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_23" title="January 23">January 23</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900" title="1900">1900</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet" title="Poet">poet</a> and divine, son of Dr James Dixon, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Wesleyan</a> minister.</p>
<p>He was educated at King Edward's school, Birmingham, and on proceeding to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_College%2C_Oxford" title="Pembroke College, Oxford">Pembroke College, Oxford</a>, became one of the famous "Birmingham group" there who shared with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris" title="William Morris">William Morris</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burne-Jones" title="Edward Burne-Jones">Burne-Jones</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood" title="Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite movement</a>. He took only a second class in moderations in 1854, and a third in <i>Literae Humaniores</i> in 1856; but in 1858 he won the Arnold prize for an historical essay, and in 1863 the English Sacred Poem prize.</p>
<p>He was ordained in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1858" title="1858">1858</a>, was second master of Carlisle high school, 1863-1868, and successively vicar of Hayton, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland%2C_England" title="Cumberland, England">Cumberland</a>, and Warkworth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumberland" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. He became minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle in 1868, and honorary canon in 1874, he was proctor in convocation (1890-1894), and received the honorary degree of D.D. from Oxford in 1899. He died at Warkworth.</p>
<p>Canon Dixon's first two volumes of verse, <i>Christ's Company</i> and <i>Historical Odes</i>, were published in 1861 and 1863 respectively; but it was not until 1883 that he attracted conspicuous notice with Mano, an historical poem in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terza_rima" title="Terza rima">terza rima</a></i>, which was enthusiastically praised by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algernon_Swinburne" title="Algernon Swinburne">Mr Swinburne</a>. This success he followed up by three privately printed volumes, <i>Odes and Eclogues</i> (1884), <i>Lyrical Poems</i> (1886), and <i>The Story of Eudocia</i> (1888).</p>
<p>Dixon's poems were during the last fifteen years of his life recognized as scholarly and refined exercises, touched with both dignity and a certain severe beauty, but he never attained any general popularity as a poet, the appeal of his poetry being directly to the scholar. A great student of history, his studies in that direction colour much of his poetry. The romantic atmosphere is remarkably preserved in <i>Mano</i>, a successful metrical exercise in the difficult terza rima.</p>
<p>His typical poems have charm and melody, without introducing any new note or variety of rhythm. He is contemplative, sober and finished in literary workmanship, a typical example of the Oxford school. Pleasant as his poetry is, however, he will probably be longest remembered by the work to which he gave the best years of his life, his <i>History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the Roman Jurisdiction</i> (1878-1902). At the time of his death he had completed six volumes, two of which were published posthumously. This fine work, covering the period from 1529 to 1570, is built upon elaborate research, and presents a trustworthy and unprejudiced survey of its subject.</p>
<p><i>Dixon's Selected Poems</i> were published in 1909 with a memoir of the author by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bridges" title="Robert Bridges">Robert Bridges</a>.</p>

初步译好了...哈哈,帮顶

Song   

█    Why fadest thou in death ,
        Oh yellow waning tree?
＝ Oh yellow waning tree, why do you fade in death?


█  Gentle is autumn's breath,
        And green the oak by thee.
  ＝autumn's breath is gentle ,and the oak is  green by thee

█   But with each wind that sighs 
        The leaves from thee take wings;
＝But the leaves take wings from thee  with each wind that sighs 

█  And bare thy branches rise 
        Above their drifted ring.
  ＝And your branches rise bare above their drifted ring.

先来戏译 ：）       歌

   何事成黄陨，①
   栖栖入幽冥？
   秋风轻如息，
   青栎犹为邻。
  
   叹嗟风阵阵，
   零落叶纷纷；
   回风转落木，
   落落杈桠擎。

①《诗·卫风·氓》：其黄而陨。

Marvelous translation!

高！


小小潘 2005-10-5 18:02:46

好啊：）给周兄助兴来也◎歌

秋风远未催紧，
竟为何，黄苦着，
独自归去，树啊，
青栎犹在君侧，在君侧！

风儿声声太息，
纷纷然，叶化羽；
东转西漂，叶啊，
故枝犹在高处，在高处！

妙哉周公 ：）秋歌  

何来竟凋亡 
见黄又日枯
秋气其煦煦
邻栎犹青苍

奈何随风叹
放翅离身游
愣枝见秃X
叶落迴XXX

译记：先歇下脑子，得空再來推敲没想好的(XXXX)字句。

妙手啊好


小末 2005-10-5 20:35:32

叩首，再叩首，小石头一抛竟引来美玉无数，这次第，怎一个好字了得并非小末偷懒，只是越看越觉得不会译，不敢译。俺好比那刚学诗的香菱丫头，念着觉着“口齿吟香”，有一种说不出来的好，却又道不白，索性原文奉送，算是各位闲暇时多些消遣。（拱手科），诸兄这厢有礼啦。


小末 2005-10-5 20:37:46

SHA兄好健的收集功夫。小末笑纳了。
