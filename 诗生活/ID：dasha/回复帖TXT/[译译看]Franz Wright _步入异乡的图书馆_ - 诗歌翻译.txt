Visiting the Library in a Strange City



by Franz Wright 



The words reappear, slowly

developing

on a vast unknown

but precise number of pages



as I enter: the great building

empty of visitors

except for me, reading

the minds of the dead— 



moving with exaggerated

and slow-motion care,

as when assigned to lead

the blind kid to his classroom 



forty years ago,

down rows

between dusty volumes, a light

snow beginning.

时间啊！我在体会着Tommy君将a Strange City写成“异乡”的趣味呢
