[试译] 小狗之日-Rupert Brooke小狗之日
－鲁佩特 布鲁克

    镇里的一切都还熟睡，
    太阳高呼一声跃出。
    无人察觉的落寞街头，
    一小狗舞之。一日方始。

他一生为善，尽其所能，
可怜的小畜已做了他当做的。
但今晨他作誓，以奥丁和托尔
及犬英烈祠之名－他忍无可忍了！

故他应允了自己的祈愿－为所欲为，
百无禁忌，仅此一日。
“Jam incipiedo, sedere facebo,”
以狗之拉丁言道： “Euge! sophos! Hurray”

他与公狗相斗，朝母狗媚眼，
这般行径前所未闻。
“食餮之耻，俺在意个球！”他嚷道，
但凡能吞下的他都吃了－而且更多。

他从老妪小腿扯下多块腱肉，
厮缠跑腿的小童－只要他能近身。
他佯装凶暴的狂犬，噬咬所有的婴孩。
随猫窜上树，且要吃它。

他们道此乃魔鬼在狂欢，
于是唤来牧师驱之；
小镇从未见识过喧哗
若小狗惹起的这般阵势－直至那日将尽。

    当血红的太阳燃烧而下，
    灯在小镇亮起，
    荒外，暮色苍茫，
    小狗死了，遂了自己的节日。

The Little Dog's Day
-Rupert Brooke

  All in the town were still asleep,
  When the sun came up with a shout and a leap.
  In the lonely streets unseen by man,
  A little dog danced. And the day began.

All his life he'd been good, as far as he could,
And the poor little beast had done all that he should.
But this morning he swore, by Odin and Thor
And the Canine Valhalla--he'd stand it no more!

So his prayer he got granted--to do just what he wanted,
Prevented by none, for the space of one day.
"Jam incipiedo, sedere facebo,"
In dog-Latin he quoth, "Euge! sophos! hurray!"

He fought with the he-dogs, and winked at the she-dogs,
A thing that had neve been heard of before.
"For the stigma of gluttony, i care not a button!" he
Cried, and ate all he chould swallow--and more.

He took away sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps,
And mangled the errand-boys--when he could get 'em.
He shammed furious rabies, and bit all the babies,
And followed the cats up the trees, and then ate 'em!

They thought t'was the devil was holding a revel,
And sent for the parson to drive him away;
For the town never knew such a hullabaloo
As that little dog raised--till the end of the day.
  
  When the blood-red sun had gone burning down,
  And the lights were lit in the little town,
  Outside, in the gloom of the twilight grey,
  The little dog died when he'd had his day.

July 1907.

里面夹杂两句拉丁语，望高手译一下，先谢了。"Jam incipiedo, sedere facebo,"
In dog-Latin he quoth, "Euge! sophos! hurray!"

进出兄，Dasha可以提供超星转的PDF文档《基础拉丁语》和《拉汉小词典》，要么？

谢谢dasha,也没有学拉丁语的野心，也试图查过一些字典，只知道hurray是欢呼的意思，其他的一无所获，呵呵
