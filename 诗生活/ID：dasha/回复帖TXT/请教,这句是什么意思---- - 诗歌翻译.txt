http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/15900.html<p>A rose is a rose is a rose</p>

<P>Meaning</P>

<P>The meaning most often attributed to this is notion that when all is said and done, a thing is what it is. This is in similar vein to Shakespeare's '<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/305250.html" taget="_blank"><b>a rose by any other name would smell as sweet</b></a>'. That's not the interpretation given by the author of the phrase though - see below. </P>

<P>Origin</P>

<P><img src="http://www.phrases.org.uk/images/stein.jpg" alt="stein" width="132" height="189" hspace="4" align="right">The line is from Gertrude Stein's poem Sacred Emily, written in 1913 and published in 1922, in 'Geography and Plays'. The verbatim line is actually, 'Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose':</P>

<blockquote>

  <p class="meanings-body">Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose<br>

    Loveliness extreme.<br>

    Extra gaiters,<br>

    Loveliness extreme.<br>

    Sweetest ice-cream.<br>

    Pages ages page ages page ages.<br>

    ...</p>

</blockquote>

<P class="meanings-body">When asked what she meant by the line, Stein said that in the time of Homer, or of Chaucer, "the poet could use the name of the thing and the thing was really there."  As memory took it over, the thing lost its identity, and she was trying to recover that - "I think in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years."</P>

<P class="meanings-body">Stein was certainly fond of the line and used variants of it in several of her works:</P>

<blockquote>

  <p class="meanings-body">- Do we suppose that all she knows is that a rose is a rose is a rose is a rose. (Operas and Plays)</p>

  <p class="meanings-body">- ... she would carve on the tree Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose until it went all the way around. (The World is Round)</p>

  <p class="meanings-body">- A rose tree may be a rose tree may be a rosy rose tree if watered.  (Alphabets and Birthdays)</p>

  <p class="meanings-body">- Indeed a rose is a rose makes a pretty plate. (Stanzas in Meditation) </p>

</blockquote>

单独一句难盯！诗语言与散文语言是不同的，无论汉语的，还是外语的。它必须在整篇诗的语言环境中才能确定。这是因为，诗语言有成分省略，也有因韵律要求而增加的成分。有时这一诗行的句子成分，被安置到下（或上）一诗行中，原因就在于：外语复合句在诗语言中的运用，往往不守常规，而是成分的安置以适应韵律的要求为宜。另外，在英语诗里面，还搀杂着大量的古英语词汇以及古英语语法和古英语诗歌句法。总之，一个单独句子，尽管都是熟悉的单词，单独拿出来，很难确定其用意。
