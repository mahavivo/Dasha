Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Slender Story of his Life is curiously twined about that<br>
of two other very considerable Figures in their Time and Country: one<br>
of whom tells the Story of all Three.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was Nizam ul Mulk, Vizier<br>
to Alp Arslan the Son, and Malik Shah the Grandson, of Toghrul Beg the<br>
Tartar, who had wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of Mahmud the<br>
Great, and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which finally roused Europe<br>
into the Crusades.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Nizam ul Mulk, in his Wasiyat--or<br>
Testament--which he wrote and left as a Memorial for future<br>
Statesmen--relates the following, as quoted in the Calcutta Review,<br>
No. 59, from Mirkhond's History of the Assassins.<br>
"'One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassan was the Imam<br>
Mowaffak of Naishapur, a man highly honored and reverenced,--may God<br>
rejoice his soul; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five, and it<br>
was the universal belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied<br>
the traditions in his presence, would assuredly attain to honor and<br>
happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this cause did my father send me from Tus to Naishapur<br>
with Abd-us-samad, the doctor of law, that I might employ myself in<br>
study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher.<br>
Towards me he ever turned an eye of favor and kindness, and as his<br>
pupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed<br>
four years in his service.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came there, I found two other<br>
pupils of mine own age newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyam, and the ill-<br>
fated Ben Sabbah.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the<br>
highest natural powers; and we three formed a close friendship<br>
together.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Imam rose from his lectures, they used to join me,<br>
and we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Omar was<br>
a native of Naishapur, while Hasan Ben Sabbah's father was one Ali, a<br>
man of austere life and practise, but heretical in his creed and<br>
doctrine.&nbsp;&nbsp;One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyam, "It is a universal<br>
belief that the pupils of the Imam Mowaffak will attain to fortune.<br>
Now, even if we all do not attain thereto, without doubt one of us<br>
will; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond?"&nbsp;&nbsp;We answered,<br>
"Be it what you please."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he said, "let us make a vow, that to<br>
whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it equally with the<br>
rest, and reserve no pre-eminence for himself."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be it so," we both<br>
replied, and on those terms we mutually pledged our words.&nbsp;&nbsp;Years<br>
rolled on, and I went from Khorassan to Transoxiana, and wandered to<br>
Ghazni and Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested with office, and<br>
rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp<br>
Arslan.'<br>
"He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both his old school-<br>
friends found him out, and came and claimed a share in his good<br>
fortune, according to the school-day vow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vizier was generous and<br>
kept his word.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasan demanded a place in the government, which the<br>
Sultan granted at the Vizier's request; but discontented with a<br>
gradual rise, he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an oriental<br>
court, and, failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor, he<br>
was disgraced and fell.&nbsp;&nbsp;After many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan<br>
became the head of the Persian sect of the Ismailians,--a party of<br>
fanatics who had long murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil<br>
eminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will.&nbsp;&nbsp;In A.D.<br>
1090, he seized the castle of Alamut, in the province of Rudbar, which<br>
lies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian Sea; and it was<br>
from this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the<br>
Crusaders as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS, and spread terror through<br>
the Mohammedan world; and it is yet disputed where the word Assassin,<br>
which they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark<br>
memorial, is derived from the hashish, or opiate of hemp-leaves (the<br>
Indian bhang), with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch<br>
of oriental desperation, or from the name of the founder of the<br>
dynasty, whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days, at Naishapur.<br>
One of the countless victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizam ul<br>
Mulk himself, the old school-boy friend.&lt;1&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;1&gt;Some of Omar's Rubaiyat warn us of the danger of Greatness, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;instability of Fortune, and while advocating Charity to all Men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recommending us to be too intimate with none.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attar makes Nizam-ul-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulk use the very words of his friend Omar [Rub. xxviii.], "When<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nizam-ul-Mulk was in the Agony (of Death) he said, 'Oh God!&nbsp;&nbsp;I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;passing away in the hand of the wind.'"<br>
"Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier to claim his share; but not to<br>
ask for title or office.&nbsp;&nbsp;'The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he<br>
said, 'is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune,<br>
to spread wide the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life<br>
and prosperity.'&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vizier tells us, that when he found Omar was<br>
really sincere in his refusal, he pressed him no further, but granted<br>
him a yearly pension of 1200 mithkals of gold from the treasury of<br>
Naishapur.<br>
"At Naishapur thus lived and died Omar Khayyam, 'busied,' adds the<br>
Vizier, 'in winning knowledge of every kind, and especially in<br>
Astronomy, wherein he attained to a very high pre-eminence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the<br>
Sultanate of Malik Shah, he came to Merv, and obtained great praise<br>
for his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered favors upon<br>
him.'<br>
"When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, Omar was one<br>
of the eight learned men employed to do it; the result was the Jalali<br>
era (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names)--'a<br>
computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and<br>
approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also the<br>
author of some astronomical tables, entitled 'Ziji-Malikshahi,' and<br>
the French have lately republished and translated an Arabic Treatise<br>
of his on Algebra.<br>
"His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyam) signifies a Tent-maker, and<br>
he is said to have at one time exercised that trade, perhaps before<br>
Nizam-ul-Mulk's generosity raised him to independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Persian<br>
poets similarly derive their names from their occupations; thus we<br>
have Attar, 'a druggist,' Assar, 'an oil presser,' etc.&lt;2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omar<br>
himself alludes to his name in the following whimsical lines:--<br>
 "'Khayyam, who stitched the tents of science,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;2&gt;Though all these, like our Smiths, Archers, Millers, Fletchers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;etc., may simply retain the Surname of an hereditary calling.<br>
"We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life, and that relates<br>
to the close; it is told in the anonymous preface which is sometimes<br>
prefixed to his poems; it has been printed in the Persian in the<br>
Appendix to Hyde's Veterum Persarum Religio, p. 499; and D'Herbelot<br>
alludes to it in his Bibliotheque, under Khiam.&lt;3&gt;--<br>
"'It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of<br>
the Wise, Omar Khayyam, died at Naishapur in the year of the Hegira,<br>
517 (A.D. 1123); in science he was unrivaled,--the very paragon of his<br>
age.&nbsp;&nbsp;Khwajah Nizami of Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates<br>
the following story: "I often used to hold conversations with my<br>
teacher, Omar Khayyam, in a garden; and one day he said to me,<br>
'My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses<br>
over it.'&nbsp;&nbsp;I wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that his were<br>
no idle words.&lt;4&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years after, when I chanced to revisit Naishapur, I<br>
went to his final resting-place, and lo! it was just outside a garden,<br>
and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden<br>
wall, and dropped their flowers upon his tomb, so that the stone was<br>
hidden under them."'"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;3&gt;"Philosophe Musulman qui a vecu en Odeur de Saintete dans sa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion, vers la Fin du premier et le Commencement du second<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Siecle," no part of which, except the "Philosophe," can apply to our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Khayyam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;4&gt;The Rashness of the Words, according to D'Herbelot, consisted in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;being so opposed to those in the Koran: "No Man knows where he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;die."--This story of Omar reminds me of another so naturally--and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;when one remembers how wide of his humble mark the noble sailor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;aimed--so pathetically told by Captain Cook--not by Doctor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawkworth--in his Second Voyage (i. 374).&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving Ulietea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oreo's last request was for me to return.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw he could not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;obtain that promise, he asked the name of my Marai (burying-place).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As strange a question as this was, I hesitated not a moment to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;him 'Stepney'; the parish in which I live when in London.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;made to repeat it several times over till they could pronounce it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and then 'Stepney Marai no Toote' was echoed through an hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mouths at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;I afterwards found the same question had been put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to Mr. Forster by a man on shore; but he gave a different, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed more proper answer, by saying, 'No man who used the sea could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;say where he should be buried.'"<br>
Thus far--without fear of Trespass--from the Calcutta Review.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
writer of it, on reading in India this story of Omar's Grave, was<br>
reminded, he says, of Cicero's Account of finding Archimedes' Tomb at<br>
Syracuse, buried in grass and weeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Thorwaldsen desired to<br>
have roses grow over him; a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the<br>
present day, I believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to return to Omar.<br>
Though the Sultan "shower'd Favors upon him," Omar's Epicurean<br>
Audacity of Thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in<br>
his own Time and Country.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is said to have been especially hated<br>
and dreaded by the Sufis, whose Practise he ridiculed, and whose Faith<br>
amounts to little more than his own, when stript of the Mysticism and<br>
formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their<br>
Poets, including Hafiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi) the<br>
most considerable in Persia, borrowed largely, indeed, of Omar's<br>
material, but turning it to a mystical Use more convenient to<br>
Themselves and the People they addressed; a People quite as quick of<br>
Doubt as of Belief; as keen of Bodily sense as of Intellectual; and<br>
delighting in a cloudy composition of both, in which they could float<br>
luxuriously between Heaven and Earth, and this World and the Next, on<br>
the wings of a poetical expression, that might serve indifferently for<br>
either.&nbsp;&nbsp;Omar was too honest of Heart as well of Head for this.<br>
Having failed (however mistakenly) of finding any Providence but<br>
Destiny, and any World but This, he set about making the most of it;<br>
preferring rather to soothe the Soul through the Senses into<br>
Acquiescence with Things as he saw them, than to perplex it with vain<br>
disquietude after what they might be.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been seen, however, that<br>
his Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant; and he very likely takes a<br>
humorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the gratification of Sense<br>
above that of the Intellect, in which he must have taken great<br>
delight, although it failed to answer the Questions in which he, in<br>
common with all men, was most vitally interested.<br>
For whatever Reason, however, Omar as before said, has never been<br>
popular in his own Country, and therefore has been but scantily<br>
transmitted abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond the<br>
average Casualties of Oriental Transcription, are so rare in the East<br>
as scarce to have reacht Westward at all, in spite of all the<br>
acquisitions of Arms and Science.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no copy at the India<br>
House, none at the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris.&nbsp;&nbsp;We know but of<br>
one in England: No. 140 of the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written<br>
at Shiraz, A.D. 1460.&nbsp;&nbsp;This contains but 158 Rubaiyat.&nbsp;&nbsp;One in the<br>
Asiatic Society's Library at Calcutta (of which we have a Copy),<br>
contains (and yet incomplete) 516, though swelled to that by all kinds<br>
of Repetition and Corruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;So Von Hammer speaks of his Copy as<br>
containing about 200, while Dr. Sprenger catalogues the Lucknow MS. at<br>
double that number.&lt;5&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scribes, too, of the Oxford and Calcutta<br>
MSS. seem to do their Work under a sort of Protest; each beginning<br>
with a Tetrastich (whether genuine or not), taken out of its<br>
alphabetical order; the Oxford with one of Apology; the Calcutta with<br>
one of Expostulation, supposed (says a Notice prefixed to the MS.)<br>
to have arisen from a Dream, in which Omar's mother asked about his<br>
future fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be rendered thus:--<br>
 "O Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How long be crying, 'Mercy on them, God!'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?"<br>
The Bodleian Quatrain pleads Pantheism by way of Justification.<br>
 "If I myself upon a looser Creed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have loosely strung the Jewel of Good deed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this one thing for my Atonement plead:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That One for Two I never did misread."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;5&gt;"Since this paper was written" (adds the Reviewer in a note), "we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have met with a Copy of a very rare Edition, printed at Calcutta in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1836.&nbsp;&nbsp;This contains 438 Tetrastichs, with an Appendix containing 54<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;others not found in some MSS."<br>
The Reviewer,&lt;6&gt; to whom I owe the Particulars of Omar's Life,<br>
concludes his Review by comparing him with Lucretius, both as to<br>
natural Temper and Genius, and as acted upon by the Circumstances in<br>
which he lived.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both indeed were men of subtle, strong, and<br>
cultivated Intellect, fine Imagination, and Hearts passionate for<br>
Truth and Justice; who justly revolted from their Country's false<br>
Religion, and false, or foolish, Devotion to it; but who fell short of<br>
replacing what they subverted by such better Hope as others, with no<br>
better Revelation to guide them, had yet made a Law to themselves.<br>
Lucretius indeed, with such material as Epicurus furnished, satisfied<br>
himself with the theory of a vast machine fortuitously constructed,<br>
and acting by a Law that implied no Legislator; and so composing<br>
himself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean severity of Attitude, sat<br>
down to contemplate the mechanical drama of the Universe which he was<br>
part Actor in; himself and all about him (as in his own sublime<br>
description of the Roman Theater) discolored with the lurid reflex of<br>
the Curtain suspended between the Spectator and the Sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Omar, more<br>
desperate, or more careless of any so complicated System as resulted<br>
in nothing but hopeless Necessity, flung his own Genius and Learning<br>
with a bitter or humorous jest into the general Ruin which their<br>
insufficient glimpses only served to reveal; and, pretending sensual<br>
pleasure, as the serious purpose of Life, only diverted himself with<br>
speculative problems of Deity, Destiny, Matter and Spirit, Good and<br>
Evil, and other such questions, easier to start than to run down, and<br>
the pursuit of which becomes a very weary sport at last!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;6&gt;Professor Cowell.<br>
With regard to the present Translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Rubaiyat (as,<br>
missing an Arabic Guttural, these Tetrastichs are more musically<br>
called) are independent Stanzas, consisting each of four Lines of<br>
equal, though varied, Prosody; sometimes all rhyming, but oftener (as<br>
here imitated) the third line a blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat as in the Greek<br>
Alcaic, where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend the Wave<br>
that falls over in the last.&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual with such kind of Oriental<br>
Verse, the Rubaiyat follow one another according to Alphabetic<br>
Rhyme--a strange succession of Grave and Gay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those here selected are<br>
strung into something of an Eclogue, with perhaps a less than equal<br>
proportion of the "Drink and make-merry," which (genuine or not)<br>
recurs over-frequently in the Original.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, the Result is sad<br>
enough: saddest perhaps when most ostentatiously merry: more apt to<br>
move Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tentmaker, who, after vainly<br>
endeavoring to unshackle his Steps from Destiny, and to catch some<br>
authentic Glimpse of TO-MORROW, fell back upon TO-DAY (which has<br>
outlasted so many To-morrows!) as the only Ground he had got to stand<br>
upon, however momentarily slipping from under his Feet.<br>
<br>
[From the Third Edition.]<br>
<br>
While the second Edition of this version of Omar was preparing,<br>
Monsieur Nicolas, French Consul at Resht, published a very careful and<br>
very good Edition of the Text, from a lithograph copy at Teheran,<br>
comprising 464 Rubaiyat, with translation and notes of his own.<br>
Mons. Nicolas, whose Edition has reminded me of several things, and<br>
instructed me in others, does not consider Omar to be the material<br>
Epicurean that I have literally taken him for, but a Mystic, shadowing<br>
the Deity under the figure of Wine, Wine-bearer, &amp;c., as Hafiz is<br>
supposed to do; in short, a Sufi Poet like Hafiz and the rest.<br>
I cannot see reason to alter my opinion, formed as it was more than a<br>
dozen years ago when Omar was first shown me by one to whom I am<br>
indebted for all I know of Oriental, and very much of other,<br>
literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;He admired Omar's Genius so much, that he would gladly<br>
have adopted any such Interpretation of his meaning as Mons. Nicolas'<br>
if he could.&lt;7&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he could not, appears by his Paper in the<br>
Calcutta Review already so largely quoted; in which he argues from the<br>
Poems themselves, as well as from what records remain of the Poet's<br>
Life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;7&gt; Perhaps would have edited the Poems himself some years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;may now as little approve of my Version on one side, as of Mons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicolas' Theory on the other.<br>
And if more were needed to disprove Mons. Nicolas' Theory, there is<br>
the Biographical Notice which he himself has drawn up in direct<br>
contradiction to the Interpretation of the Poems given in his Notes.<br>
(See pp. 13-14 of his Preface.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed I hardly knew poor Omar was so<br>
far gone till his Apologist informed me.&nbsp;&nbsp;For here we see that,<br>
whatever were the Wine that Hafiz drank and sang, the veritable Juice<br>
of the Grape it was which Omar used, not only when carousing with his<br>
friends, but (says Mons. Nicolas) in order to excite himself to that<br>
pitch of Devotion which others reached by cries and "hurlemens."&nbsp;&nbsp;And<br>
yet, whenever Wine, Wine-bearer, &amp;c., occur in the Text--which is<br>
often enough--Mons. Nicolas carefully annotates "Dieu," "La Divinite,"<br>
&amp;c.: so carefully indeed that one is tempted to think that he was<br>
indoctrinated by the Sufi with whom he read the Poems.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Note to Rub.<br>
ii. p. 8.)&nbsp;&nbsp;A Persian would naturally wish to vindicate a<br>
distinguished Countryman; and a Sufi to enroll him in his own sect,<br>
which already comprises all the chief Poets of Persia.<br>
What historical Authority has Mons. Nicolas to show that Omar gave<br>
himself up "avec passion a l'etude de la philosophie des Soufis"?<br>
(Preface, p. xiii.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doctrines of Pantheism, Materialism,<br>
Necessity, &amp;c., were not peculiar to the Sufi; nor to Lucretius before<br>
them; nor to Epicurus before him; probably the very original<br>
Irreligion of Thinking men from the first; and very likely to be the<br>
spontaneous growth of a Philosopher living in an Age of social and<br>
political barbarism, under shadow of one of the Two and Seventy<br>
Religions supposed to divide the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Hammer (according to<br>
Sprenger's Oriental Catalogue) speaks of Omar as "a Free-thinker, and<br>
a great opponent of Sufism;" perhaps because, while holding much of<br>
their Doctrine, he would not pretend to any inconsistent severity of<br>
morals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir W. Ouseley has written a note to something of the same<br>
effect on the fly-leaf of the Bodleian MS.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in two Rubaiyat of<br>
Mons. Nicolas' own Edition Suf and Sufi are both disparagingly named.<br>
No doubt many of these Quatrains seem unaccountable unless mystically<br>
interpreted; but many more as unaccountable unless literally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Were<br>
the Wine spiritual, for instance, how wash the Body with it when dead?<br>
Why make cups of the dead clay to be filled with--"La Divinite," by<br>
some succeeding Mystic?&nbsp;&nbsp;Mons. Nicolas himself is puzzled by some<br>
"bizarres" and "trop Orientales" allusions and images--"d'une<br>
sensualite quelquefois revoltante" indeed--which "les convenances" do<br>
not permit him to translate; but still which the reader cannot but<br>
refer to "La Divinite."&lt;8&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt also many of the Quatrains in the<br>
Teheran, as in the Calcutta, Copies, are spurious; such Rubaiyat being<br>
the common form of Epigram in Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this, at best, tells as<br>
much one way as another; nay, the Sufi, who may be considered the<br>
Scholar and Man of Letters in Persia, would be far more likely than<br>
the careless Epicure to interpolate what favours his own view of the<br>
Poet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I observed that very few of the more mystical Quatrains are in<br>
the Bodleian MS., which must be one of the oldest, as dated at Shiraz,<br>
A.H. 865, A.D. 1460.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this, I think, especially distinguishes Omar<br>
(I cannot help calling him by his--no, not Christian--familiar name)<br>
from all other Persian Poets: That, whereas with them the Poet is lost<br>
in his Song, the Man in Allegory and Abstraction; we seem to have the<br>
Man--the Bon-homme--Omar himself, with all his Humours and Passions,<br>
as frankly before us as if we were really at Table with him, after the<br>
Wine had gone round.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;8&gt; A note to Quatrain 234 admits that, however clear the mystical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;meaning of such Images must be to Europeans, they are not quoted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;without "rougissant" even by laymen in Persia--"Quant aux termes de<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tendresse qui commencent ce quatrain, comme tant d'autres dans ce<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;recueil, nos lecteurs, habitues maintenant a 1'etrangete des<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;expressions si souvent employees par Kheyam pour rendre ses pensees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sur l'amour divin, et a la singularite des images trop orientales,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;d'une sensualite quelquefois revoltante, n'auront pas de peine a se<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;persuader qu'il s'agit de la Divinite, bien que cette conviction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;soit vivement discutee par les moullahs musulmans, et meme par<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;beaucoup de laiques, qui rougissent veritablement d'une pareille<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;licence de leur compatriote a 1'egard des choses spirituelles."<br>
I must say that I, for one, never wholly believed in the Mysticism of<br>
Hafiz.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not appear there was any danger in holding and singing<br>
Sufi Pantheism, so long as the Poet made his Salaam to Mohammed at the<br>
beginning and end of his Song.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such conditions Jelaluddin,<br>
Jami, Attar, and others sang; using Wine and Beauty indeed as Images<br>
to illustrate, not as a Mask to hide, the Divinity they were<br>
celebrating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps some Allegory less liable to mistake or abuse<br>
had been better among so inflammable a People: much more so when, as<br>
some think with Hafiz and Omar, the abstract is not only likened to,<br>
but identified with, the sensual Image; hazardous, if not to the<br>
Devotee himself, yet to his weaker Brethren; and worse for the Profane<br>
in proportion as the Devotion of the Initiated grew warmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;And all<br>
for what?&nbsp;&nbsp;To be tantalized with Images of sensual enjoyment which<br>
must be renounced if one would approximate a God, who according to the<br>
Doctrine, is Sensual Matter as well as Spirit, and into whose Universe<br>
one expects unconsciously to merge after Death, without hope of any<br>
posthumous Beatitude in another world to compensate for all one's self-<br>
denial in this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucretius' blind Divinity certainly merited, and<br>
probably got, as much self-sacrifice as this of the Sufi; and the<br>
burden of Omar's Song--if not "Let us eat"--is assuredly--"Let us<br>
drink, for To-morrow we die!"&nbsp;&nbsp;And if Hafiz meant quite otherwise by a<br>
similar language, he surely miscalculated when he devoted his Life and<br>
Genius to so equivocal a Psalmody as, from his Day to this, has been<br>
said and sung by any rather than spiritual Worshippers.<br>
However, as there is some traditional presumption, and certainly the<br>
opinion of some learned men, in favour of Omar's being a Sufi--and<br>
even something of a Saint--those who please may so interpret his Wine<br>
and Cup-bearer.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, as there is far more historical<br>
certainty of his being a Philosopher, of scientific Insight and<br>
Ability far beyond that of the Age and Country he lived in; of such<br>
moderate worldly Ambition as becomes a Philosopher, and such moderate<br>
wants as rarely satisfy a Debauchee; other readers may be content to<br>
believe with me that, while the Wine Omar celebrates is simply the<br>
Juice of the Grape, he bragg'd more than he drank of it, in very<br>
defiance perhaps of that Spiritual Wine which left its Votaries sunk<br>
in Hypocrisy or Disgust.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;And Lo! the Hunter of the East has caught<br>
 The Sultan's Turret in a Noose of Light.<br>
<br>
II.<br>
 Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky<br>
 I heard a Voice within the Tavern cry,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup<br>
 Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry."<br>
<br>
III.<br>
 And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br>
 The Tavern shouted--"Open then the Door.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;You know how little while we have to stay,<br>
 And, once departed, may return no more."<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
 Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br>
 The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough<br>
 Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.<br>
<br>
V.<br>
 Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,<br>
 And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields,<br>
 And still a Garden by the Water blows.<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
 And David's Lips are lock't; but in divine<br>
 High piping Pelevi, with "Wine!&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine!&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Red Wine!"--the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br>
 That yellow Cheek of hers to'incarnadine.<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
 Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of Spring<br>
 The Winter Garment of Repentance fling:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bird of Time has but a little way<br>
 To fly--and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
 And look--a thousand Blossoms with the Day<br>
 Woke--and a thousand scatter'd into Clay:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And this first Summer Month that brings the Rose<br>
 Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
 But come with old Khayyam, and leave the Lot<br>
 Of Kaikobad and Kaikhosru forgot:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Let Rustum lay about him as he will,<br>
 Or Hatim Tai cry Supper--heed them not.<br>
<br>
X.<br>
 With me along some Strip of Herbage strown<br>
 That just divides the desert from the sown,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Where name of Slave and Sultan scarce is known,<br>
 And pity Sultan Mahmud on his Throne.<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
 Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,<br>
 A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse--and Thou<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beside me singing in the Wilderness--<br>
 And Wilderness is Paradise enow.<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
 "How sweet is mortal Sovranty!"--think some:<br>
 Others--"How blest the Paradise to come!"<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest;<br>
 Oh, the brave Music of a distant Drum!<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
 Look to the Rose that blows about us--"Lo,<br>
 Laughing," she says, "into the World I blow:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;At once the silken Tassel of my Purse<br>
 Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw."<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
 The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br>
 Turns Ashes--or it prospers; and anon,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face<br>
 Lighting a little Hour or two--is gone.<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
 And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,<br>
 And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'd<br>
 As, buried once, Men want dug up again.<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
 Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai<br>
 Whose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp<br>
 Abode his Hour or two, and went his way.<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
 They say the Lion and the Lizard keep<br>
 The Courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And Bahram, that great Hunter--the Wild Ass<br>
 Stamps o'er his Head, and he lies fast asleep.<br>
<br>
XVIII.<br>
 I sometimes think that never blows so red<br>
 The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That every Hyacinth the Garden wears<br>
 Dropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head.<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
 And this delightful Herb whose tender Green<br>
 Fledges the River's Lip on which we lean--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows<br>
 From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
 Ah! my Beloved, fill the Cup that clears<br>
 TO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;To-morrow?--Why, To-morrow I may be<br>
 Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years.<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
 Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and the best<br>
 That Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,<br>
 And one by one crept silently to Rest.<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
 And we, that now make merry in the Room<br>
 They left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth<br>
 Descend, ourselves to make a Couch--for whom?<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
 Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,<br>
 Before we too into the Dust Descend;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie,<br>
 Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer and--sans End!<br>
<br>
XXIV.<br>
 Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,<br>
 And those that after a TO-MORROW stare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries<br>
 "Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There."<br>
<br>
XXV.<br>
 Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd<br>
 Of the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrust<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br>
 Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.<br>
<br>
XXVI.<br>
 Oh, come with old Khayyam, and leave the Wise<br>
 To talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;<br>
 The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
 Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br>
 Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;About it and about: but evermore<br>
 Came out by the same Door as in I went.<br>
<br>
XXVIII.<br>
 With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,<br>
 And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd--<br>
 "I came like Water, and like Wind I go."<br>
<br>
XXIX.<br>
 Into this Universe, and why not knowing,<br>
 Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br>
 I know not whither, willy-nilly blowing.<br>
<br>
XXX.<br>
 What, without asking, hither hurried whence?<br>
 And, without asking, whither hurried hence!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Another and another Cup to drown<br>
 The Memory of this Impertinence!<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
 Up from Earth's Centre through the seventh Gate<br>
 I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And many Knots unravel'd by the Road;<br>
 But not the Knot of Human Death and Fate.<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
 There was a Door to which I found no Key:<br>
 There was a Veil past which I could not see:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Some little Talk awhile of ME and THEE<br>
 There seemed--and then no more of THEE and ME.<br>
<br>
XXXIII.<br>
 Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,<br>
 Asking, "What Lamp had Destiny to guide<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Her little Children stumbling in the Dark?"<br>
 And--"A blind understanding!" Heav'n replied.<br>
<br>
XXXIV.<br>
 Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjourn<br>
 My Lip the secret Well of Life to learn:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And Lip to Lip it murmur'd--"While you live,<br>
 Drink!--for once dead you never shall return."<br>
<br>
XXXV.<br>
 I think the Vessel, that with fugitive<br>
 Articulation answer'd, once did live,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And merry-make; and the cold Lip I kiss'd<br>
 How many Kisses might it take--and give.<br>
<br>
XXXVI.<br>
 For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,<br>
 I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And with its all obliterated Tongue<br>
 It murmur'd--"Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"<br>
<br>
XXXVII.<br>
 Ah, fill the Cup:--what boots it to repeat<br>
 How Time is slipping underneath our Feet:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Unborn TO-MORROW and dead YESTERDAY,<br>
 Why fret about them if TO-DAY be sweet!<br>
<br>
XXXVIII.<br>
 One Moment in Annihilation's Waste,<br>
 One moment, of the Well of Life to taste--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Stars are setting, and the Caravan<br>
 Starts for the dawn of Nothing--Oh, make haste!<br>
<br>
XXXIX.<br>
 How long, how long, in infinite Pursuit<br>
 Of This and That endeavour and dispute?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Better be merry with the fruitful Grape<br>
 Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.<br>
<br>
XL.<br>
 You know, my Friends, how long since in my House<br>
 For a new Marriage I did make Carouse:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br>
 And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.<br>
<br>
XLI.<br>
 For "IS" and "IS-NOT" though with Rule and Line,<br>
 And, "UP-AND-DOWN" without, I could define,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;I yet in all I only cared to know,<br>
 Was never deep in anything but--Wine.<br>
<br>
XLII.<br>
 And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,<br>
 Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel Shape,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Bearing a vessel on his Shoulder; and<br>
 He bid me taste of it; and 'twas--the Grape!<br>
<br>
XLIII.<br>
 The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br>
 The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The subtle Alchemist that in a Trice<br>
 Life's leaden Metal into Gold transmute.<br>
<br>
XLIV.<br>
 The mighty Mahmud, the victorious Lord,<br>
 That all the misbelieving and black Horde<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul<br>
 Scatters and slays with his enchanted Sword.<br>
<br>
XLV.<br>
 But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with me<br>
 The Quarrel of the Universe let be:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And, in some corner of the Hubbub coucht,<br>
 Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee.<br>
<br>
XLVI.<br>
 For in and out, above, about, below,<br>
 'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,<br>
 Round which we Phantom Figures come and go.<br>
<br>
XLVII.<br>
 And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press,<br>
 End in the Nothing all Things end in--Yes-<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Then fancy while Thou art, Thou art but what<br>
 Thou shalt be--Nothing--Thou shalt not be less.<br>
<br>
XLVIII.<br>
 While the Rose blows along the River Brink,<br>
 With old Khayyam the Ruby Vintage drink:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And when the Angel with his darker Draught<br>
 Draws up to thee--take that, and do not shrink.<br>
<br>
XLVIX.<br>
 'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days<br>
 Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,<br>
 And one by one back in the Closet lays.<br>
<br>
L.<br>
 The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,<br>
 But Right or Left as strikes the Player goes;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And He that toss'd Thee down into the Field,<br>
 He knows about it all--HE knows--HE knows!<br>
<br>
LI.<br>
 The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
 Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>
 Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.<br>
<br>
LII.<br>
 And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,<br>
 Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lift not thy hands to IT for help--for It<br>
 Rolls impotently on as Thou or I.<br>
<br>
LIII.<br>
 With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man's knead,<br>
 And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Yea, the first Morning of Creation wrote<br>
 What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.<br>
<br>
LIV.<br>
 I tell Thee this--When, starting from the Goal,<br>
 Over the shoulders of the flaming Foal<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,<br>
 In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and Soul<br>
<br>
LV.<br>
 The Vine had struck a Fibre; which about<br>
 It clings my Being--let the Sufi flout;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of my Base Metal may be filed a Key,<br>
 That shall unlock the Door he howls without.<br>
<br>
LVI.<br>
 And this I know: whether the one True Light,<br>
 Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caught<br>
 Better than in the Temple lost outright.<br>
<br>
LVII.<br>
 Oh Thou who didst with Pitfall and with Gin<br>
 Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Thou wilt not with Predestination round<br>
 Enmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin?<br>
<br>
LVIII.<br>
 Oh Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br>
 And who with Eden didst devise the Snake;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man<br>
 Is blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give--and take!<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
KUZA--NAMA. ("Book of Pots")<br>
<br>
LIX.<br>
 Listen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;One Evening at the Close<br>
 Of Ramazan, ere the better Moon arose,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;In that old Potter's Shop I stood alone<br>
 With the clay Population round in Rows.<br>
<br>
LX.<br>
 And strange to tell, among that Earthen Lot<br>
 Some could articulate, while others not:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And suddenly one more impatient cried--<br>
 "Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"<br>
<br>
LXI.<br>
 Then said another--"Surely not in vain<br>
 My substance from the common Earth was ta'en,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That He who subtly wrought me into Shape<br>
 Should stamp me back to common Earth again."<br>
<br>
LXII.<br>
 Another said--"Why, ne'er a peevish Boy<br>
 Would break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Shall He that made the Vessel in pure Love<br>
 And Fansy, in an after Rage destroy!"<br>
<br>
LXIII.<br>
 None answer'd this; but after Silence spake<br>
 A Vessel of a more ungainly Make:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"They sneer at me for leaning all awry;<br>
 What? did the Hand then of the Potter shake?"<br>
<br>
LXIV.<br>
 Said one--"Folks of a surly Tapster tell,<br>
 And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;They talk of some strict Testing of us--Pish!<br>
 He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well."<br>
<br>
LXV.<br>
 Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,<br>
 "My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,<br>
 Methinks I might recover by-and-bye!"<br>
<br>
LXVI.<br>
 So, while the Vessels one by one were speaking,<br>
 One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!<br>
 Hark to the Porter's Shoulder-knot a-creaking!"<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
LXVII.<br>
 Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,<br>
 And wash my Body whence the life has died,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And in a Windingsheet of Vineleaf wrapt,<br>
 So bury me by some sweet Gardenside.<br>
<br>
LXVIII.<br>
 That ev'n my buried Ashes such a Snare<br>
 Of Perfume shall fling up into the Air,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;As not a True Believer passing by<br>
 But shall be overtaken unaware.<br>
<br>
LXIX.<br>
 Indeed, the Idols I have loved so long<br>
 Have done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,<br>
 And sold my Reputation for a Song.<br>
<br>
LXX.<br>
 Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before<br>
 I swore--but was I sober when I swore?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand<br>
 My thread-bare Penitence a-pieces tore.<br>
<br>
LXXI.<br>
 And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,<br>
 And robb'd me of my Robe of Honour--well,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;I often wonder what the Vintners buy<br>
 One half so precious as the Goods they sell.<br>
<br>
LXXII.<br>
 Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!<br>
 That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,<br>
 Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows!<br>
<br>
LXXIII.<br>
 Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire<br>
 To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Would not we shatter it to bits--and then<br>
 Re-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!<br>
<br>
LXXIV.<br>
 Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,<br>
 The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;How oft hereafter rising shall she look<br>
 Through this same Garden after me--in vain!<br>
<br>
LXXV.<br>
 And when Thyself with shining Foot shall pass<br>
 Among the Guests Star-scatter'd on The Grass,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And in Thy joyous Errand reach the Spot<br>
 Where I made one--turn down an empty Glass!<br>

 WAKE! For the Sun, who scatter'd into flight<br>
 The Stars before him from the Field of Night,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Drives Night along with them from Heav'n, and strikes<br>
 The Sultan's Turret with a Shaft of Light.<br>
<br>
II.<br>
 Before the phantom of False morning died,<br>
 Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"When all the Temple is prepared within,<br>
 "Why nods the drowsy Worshiper outside?"<br>
<br>
III.<br>
 And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before<br>
 The Tavern shouted--"Open then the Door!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"You know how little while we have to stay,<br>
 And, once departed, may return no more."<br>
<br>
IV.<br>
 Now the New Year reviving old Desires,<br>
 The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the Bough<br>
 Puts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.<br>
<br>
V.<br>
 Iram indeed is gone with all his Rose,<br>
 And Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine,<br>
 And many a Garden by the Water blows.<br>
<br>
VI.<br>
 And David's lips are lockt; but in divine<br>
 High-piping Pehlevi, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"Red Wine!"--the Nightingale cries to the Rose<br>
 That sallow cheek of hers to' incarnadine.<br>
<br>
VII.<br>
 Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring<br>
 Your Winter garment of Repentance fling:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bird of Time has but a little way<br>
 To flutter--and the Bird is on the Wing.<br>
<br>
VIII.<br>
 Whether at Naishapur or Babylon,<br>
 Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,<br>
 The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.<br>
<br>
IX.<br>
 Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say:<br>
 Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And this first Summer month that brings the Rose<br>
 Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.<br>
<br>
X.<br>
 Well, let it take them!&nbsp;&nbsp;What have we to do<br>
 With Kaikobad the Great, or Kaikhosru?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Let Zal and Rustum bluster as they will,<br>
 Or Hatim call to Supper--heed not you.<br>
<br>
XI.<br>
 With me along the strip of Herbage strown<br>
 That just divides the desert from the sown,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Where name of Slave and Sultan is forgot--<br>
 And Peace to Mahmud on his golden Throne!<br>
<br>
XII.<br>
 A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,<br>
 A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread--and Thou<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Beside me singing in the Wilderness--<br>
 Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!<br>
<br>
XIII.<br>
 Some for the Glories of This World; and some<br>
 Sigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,<br>
 Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!<br>
<br>
XIV.<br>
 Look to the blowing Rose about us--"Lo,<br>
 Laughing," she says, "into the world I blow,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;At once the silken tassel of my Purse<br>
 Tear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw."<br>
<br>
XV.<br>
 And those who husbanded the Golden grain,<br>
 And those who flung it to the winds like Rain,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'd<br>
 As, buried once, Men want dug up again.<br>
<br>
XVI.<br>
 The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts upon<br>
 Turns Ashes--or it prospers; and anon,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face,<br>
 Lighting a little hour or two--is gone.<br>
<br>
XVII.<br>
 Think, in this batter'd Caravanserai<br>
 Whose Portals are alternate Night and Day,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;How Sultan after Sultan with his Pomp<br>
 Abode his destined Hour, and went his way.<br>

 They say the Lion and the Lizard keep<br>
 The courts where Jamshyd gloried and drank deep:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And Bahram, that great Hunter--the Wild Ass<br>
 Stamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep.<br>
<br>
XIX.<br>
 I sometimes think that never blows so red<br>
 The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;That every Hyacinth the Garden wears<br>
 Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.<br>
<br>
XX.<br>
 And this reviving Herb whose tender Green<br>
 Fledges the River-Lip on which we lean--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows<br>
 From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!<br>
<br>
XXI.<br>
 Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clears<br>
 TO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;To-morrow--Why, To-morrow I may be<br>
 Myself with Yesterday's Sev'n thousand Years.<br>
<br>
XXII.<br>
 For some we loved, the loveliest and the best<br>
 That from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,<br>
 And one by one crept silently to rest.<br>
<br>
XXIII.<br>
 And we, that now make merry in the Room<br>
 They left, and Summer dresses in new bloom,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of Earth<br>

 Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,<br>
 Before we too into the Dust descend;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie,<br>
 Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and--sans End!<br>

 Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,<br>
 And those that after some TO-MORROW stare,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A Muezzin from the Tower of Darkness cries,<br>

 Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd<br>
 Of the Two Worlds so wisely--they are thrust<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br>
 Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.<br>
<br>
XXVII.<br>
 Myself when young did eagerly frequent<br>
 Doctor and Saint, and heard great argument<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;About it and about: but evermore<br>
 Came out by the same door where in I went.<br>

 Into this Universe, and Why not knowing<br>
 Nor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,<br>
 I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.<br>

XXX.<br>
 What, without asking, hither hurried Whence?<br>
 And, without asking, Whither hurried hence!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine<br>
 Must drown the memory of that insolence!<br>
<br>
XXXI.<br>
 Up from Earth's Center through the Seventh Gate<br>
 I rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road;<br>
 But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.<br>
<br>
XXXII.<br>
 There was the Door to which I found no Key;<br>
 There was the Veil through which I might not see:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Some little talk awhile of ME and THEE<br>
 There was--and then no more of THEE and ME.<br>
<br>
XXXIII.<br>
 Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mourn<br>
 In flowing Purple, of their Lord Forlorn;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Nor rolling Heaven, with all his Signs reveal'd<br>
 And hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn.<br>
<br>
XXXIV.<br>
 Then of the THEE IN ME who works behind<br>
 The Veil, I lifted up my hands to find<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A lamp amid the Darkness; and I heard,<br>
 As from Without--"THE ME WITHIN THEE BLIND!"<br>
<br>
XXXV.<br>
 Then to the Lip of this poor earthen Urn<br>
 I lean'd, the Secret of my Life to learn:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And Lip to Lip it murmur'd--"While you live,<br>
 "Drink!--for, once dead, you never shall return."<br>
<br>
XXXVI.<br>
 I think the Vessel, that with fugitive<br>
 Articulation answer'd, once did live,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And drink; and Ah! the passive Lip I kiss'd,<br>
 How many Kisses might it take--and give!<br>
<br>
XXXVII.<br>
 For I remember stopping by the way<br>
 To watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And with its all-obliterated Tongue<br>
 It murmur'd--"Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"<br>
<br>
XXXVIII.<br>
 And has not such a Story from of Old<br>
 Down Man's successive generations roll'd<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of such a clod of saturated Earth<br>
 Cast by the Maker into Human mold?<br>
<br>
XXXIX.<br>
 And not a drop that from our Cups we throw<br>
 For Earth to drink of, but may steal below<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;To quench the fire of Anguish in some Eye<br>
 There hidden--far beneath, and long ago.<br>
<br>
XL.<br>
 As then the Tulip for her morning sup<br>
 Of Heav'nly Vintage from the soil looks up,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you devoutly do the like, till Heav'n<br>
 To Earth invert you--like an empty Cup.<br>
<br>
XLI.<br>
 Perplext no more with Human or Divine,<br>
 To-morrow's tangle to the winds resign,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And lose your fingers in the tresses of<br>
 The Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.<br>
<br>
XLII.<br>
 And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press,<br>
 End in what All begins and ends in--Yes;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Think then you are TO-DAY what YESTERDAY<br>
 You were--TO-MORROW you shall not be less.<br>
<br>
XLIII.<br>
 So when that Angel of the darker Drink<br>
 At last shall find you by the river-brink,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And, offering his Cup, invite your Soul<br>
 Forth to your Lips to quaff--you shall not shrink.<br>
<br>
XLIV.<br>
 Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,<br>
 And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Were't not a Shame--were't not a Shame for him<br>
 In this clay carcass crippled to abide?<br>
<br>
XLV.<br>
 'Tis but a Tent where takes his one day's rest<br>
 A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash<br>
 Strikes, and prepares it for another Guest.<br>
<br>
XLVI.<br>
 And fear not lest Existence closing your<br>
 Account, and mine, should know the like no more;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has pour'd<br>
 Millions of Bubbles like us, and will pour.<br>
<br>
XLVII.<br>
 When You and I behind the Veil are past,<br>
 Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Which of our Coming and Departure heeds<br>
 As the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast.<br>
<br>
XLVIII.<br>
 A Moment's Halt--a momentary taste<br>
 Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And Lo!--the phantom Caravan has reach'd<br>
 The NOTHING it set out from--Oh, make haste!<br>
<br>
XLIX.<br>
 Would you that spangle of Existence spend<br>
 About THE SECRET--quick about it, Friend!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A Hair perhaps divides the False from True--<br>
 And upon what, prithee, may life depend?<br>
<br>
L.<br>
 A Hair perhaps divides the False and True;<br>
 Yes; and a single Alif were the clue--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Could you but find it--to the Treasure-house,<br>
 And peradventure to THE MASTER too;<br>
<br>
LI.<br>
 Whose secret Presence through Creation's veins<br>
 Running Quicksilver-like eludes your pains;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Taking all shapes from Mah to Mahi and<br>
 They change and perish all--but He remains;<br>
<br>
LII.<br>
 A moment guessed--then back behind the Fold<br>
 Immerst of Darkness round the Drama roll'd<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Which, for the Pastime of Eternity,<br>
 He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold.<br>
<br>
LIII.<br>
 But if in vain, down on the stubborn floor<br>
 Of Earth, and up to Heav'n's unopening Door,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;You gaze TO-DAY, while You are You--how then<br>
 TO-MORROW, when You shall be You no more?<br>
<br>
LIV.<br>
 Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuit<br>
 Of This and That endeavor and dispute;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape<br>
 Than sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.<br>
<br>
LV.<br>
 You know, my Friends, with what a brave Carouse<br>
 I made a Second Marriage in my house;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,<br>
 And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.<br>
<br>
LVI.<br>
 For "Is" and "Is-not" though with Rule and Line<br>
 And "UP-AND-DOWN" by Logic I define,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of all that one should care to fathom, I<br>
 was never deep in anything but--Wine.<br>
<br>
LVII.<br>
 Ah, by my Computations, People say,<br>
 Reduce the Year to better reckoning?--Nay,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;'Twas only striking from the Calendar<br>
 Unborn To-morrow and dead Yesterday.<br>
<br>
LVIII.<br>
 And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,<br>
 Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and<br>
 He bid me taste of it; and 'twas--the Grape!<br>
<br>
LIX.<br>
 The Grape that can with Logic absolute<br>
 The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice<br>
 Life's leaden metal into Gold transmute;<br>
<br>
LX.<br>
 The mighty Mahmud, Allah-breathing Lord,<br>
 That all the misbelieving and black Horde<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Fears and Sorrows that infest the Soul<br>
 Scatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.<br>
<br>
LXI.<br>
 Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dare<br>
 Blaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?<br>
 And if a Curse--why, then, Who set it there?<br>
<br>
LXII.<br>
 I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,<br>
 Scared by some After-reckoning ta'en on trust,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink,<br>
 To fill the Cup--when crumbled into Dust!<br>
<br>
LXIII.<br>
 Of threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!<br>
 One thing at least is certain--This Life flies;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;<br>
 The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.<br>
<br>
LXIV.<br>
 Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who<br>
 Before us pass'd the door of Darkness through,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Not one returns to tell us of the Road,<br>
 Which to discover we must travel too.<br>
<br>
LXV.<br>
 The Revelations of Devout and Learn'd<br>
 Who rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Are all but Stories, which, awoke from Sleep<br>
 They told their comrades, and to Sleep return'd.<br>
<br>
LXVI.<br>
 I sent my Soul through the Invisible,<br>
 Some letter of that After-life to spell:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And by and by my Soul return'd to me,<br>
 And answer'd "I Myself am Heav'n and Hell:"<br>
<br>
LXVII.<br>
 Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,<br>
 And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,<br>
 So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.<br>
<br>
LXVIII.<br>
 We are no other than a moving row<br>
 Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern held<br>
 In Midnight by the Master of the Show;<br>
<br>
LXIX.<br>
 But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays<br>
 Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,<br>
 And one by one back in the Closet lays.<br>
<br>
LXX.<br>
 The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes,<br>
 But Here or There as strikes the Player goes;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And He that toss'd you down into the Field,<br>
 He knows about it all--HE knows--HE knows!<br>
<br>
LXXI.<br>
 The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,<br>
 Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,<br>
 Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.<br>
<br>
LXXII.<br>
 And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,<br>
 Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Lift not your hands to It for help--for It<br>
 As impotently moves as you or I.<br>
<br>
LXXIII.<br>
 With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,<br>
 And there of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And the first Morning of Creation wrote<br>
 What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.<br>
<br>
LXXIV.<br>
 YESTERDAY This Day's Madness did prepare;<br>
 TO-MORROW's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Drink! for you not know whence you came, nor why:<br>
 Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.<br>
<br>
LXXV.<br>
 I tell you this--When, started from the Goal,<br>
 Over the flaming shoulders of the Foal<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of Heav'n Parwin and Mushtari they flung,<br>
 In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul.<br>
<br>
LXXVI.<br>
 The Vine had struck a fiber: which about<br>
 It clings my Being--let the Dervish flout;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of my Base metal may be filed a Key<br>
 That shall unlock the Door he howls without.<br>
<br>
LXXVII.<br>
 And this I know: whether the one True Light<br>
 Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;One Flash of It within the Tavern caught<br>
 Better than in the Temple lost outright.<br>
<br>
LXXVIII.<br>
 What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke<br>
 A conscious Something to resent the yoke<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain<br>
 Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke!<br>
<br>
LXXIX.<br>
 What! from his helpless Creature be repaid<br>
 Pure Gold for what he lent him dross-allay'd--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Sue for a Debt he never did contract,<br>
 And cannot answer--Oh the sorry trade!<br>
<br>
LXXX.<br>
 Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with gin<br>
 Beset the Road I was to wander in,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round<br>
 Enmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!<br>
<br>
LXXXI.<br>
 Oh Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,<br>
 And ev'n with Paradise devise the Snake:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;For all the Sin wherewith the Face of Man<br>
 Is blacken'd--Man's forgiveness give--and take!<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
LXXXII.<br>
 As under cover of departing Day<br>
 Slunk hunger-stricken Ramazan away,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Once more within the Potter's house alone<br>
 I stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay.<br>
<br>
LXXXIII.<br>
 Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small,<br>
 That stood along the floor and by the wall;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And some loquacious Vessels were; and some<br>
 Listen'd perhaps, but never talk'd at all.<br>
<br>
LXXXIV.<br>
 Said one among them--"Surely not in vain<br>
 My substance of the common Earth was ta'en<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And to this Figure molded, to be broke,<br>
 Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again."<br>
<br>
LXXXV.<br>
 Then said a Second--"Ne'er a peevish Boy<br>
 Would break the Bowl from which he drank in joy;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And He that with his hand the Vessel made<br>
 Will surely not in after Wrath destroy."<br>
<br>
LXXXVI.<br>
 After a momentary silence spake<br>
 Some Vessel of a more ungainly Make;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"They sneer at me for leaning all awry:<br>
 What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?"<br>
<br>
LXXXVII.<br>
 Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot--<br>
 I think a Sufi pipkin--waxing hot--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;"All this of Pot and Potter--Tell me then,<br>
 Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"<br>
<br>
LXXXVIII.<br>
 "Why," said another, "Some there are who tell<br>
 Of one who threatens he will toss to Hell<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The luckless Pots he marr'd in making--Pish!<br>
 He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well."<br>
<br>
LXXXIX.<br>
 "Well," murmured one, "Let whoso make or buy,<br>
 My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;But fill me with the old familiar Juice,<br>
 Methinks I might recover by and by."<br>
<br>
XC.<br>
 So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,<br>
 The little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!<br>
 Now for the Porter's shoulders' knot a-creaking!"<br>
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *<br>
<br>
XCI.<br>
 Ah, with the Grape my fading life provide,<br>
 And wash the Body whence the Life has died,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf,<br>
 By some not unfrequented Garden-side.<br>
<br>
XCII.<br>
 That ev'n buried Ashes such a snare<br>
 Of Vintage shall fling up into the Air<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;As not a True-believer passing by<br>
 But shall be overtaken unaware.<br>
<br>
XCIII.<br>
 Indeed the Idols I have loved so long<br>
 Have done my credit in this World much wrong:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Have drown'd my Glory in a shallow Cup,<br>
 And sold my reputation for a Song.<br>
<br>
XCIV.<br>
 Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft before<br>
 I swore--but was I sober when I swore?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-hand<br>
 My thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.<br>
<br>
XCV.<br>
 And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,<br>
 And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor--Well,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;I wonder often what the Vintners buy<br>
 One half so precious as the stuff they sell.<br>
<br>
XCVI.<br>
 Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!<br>
 That Youth's sweet-scented manuscript should close!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The Nightingale that in the branches sang,<br>
 Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!<br>
<br>
XCVII.<br>
 Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield<br>
 One glimpse--if dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;To which the fainting Traveler might spring,<br>
 As springs the trampled herbage of the field!<br>
<br>
XCVIII.<br>
 Would but some winged Angel ere too late<br>
 Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And make the stern Recorder otherwise<br>
 Enregister, or quite obliterate!<br>
<br>
XCIX.<br>
 Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire<br>
 To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Would not we shatter it to bits--and then<br>
 Re-mold it nearer to the Heart's Desire!<br>
<br>
C.<br>
 Yon rising Moon that looks for us again--<br>
 How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;How oft hereafter rising look for us<br>
 Through this same Garden--and for one in vain!<br>
<br>
CI.<br>
 And when like her, oh Saki, you shall pass<br>
 Among the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;And in your joyous errand reach the spot<br>
 Where I made One--turn down an empty Glass!<br>

Notes<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[The references are, except in the first note only, to the stanzas of<br>
the Fifth edition.]<br>
<br>
(Stanza I.) Flinging a Stone into the Cup was the signal for "To<br>
Horse!" in the Desert.<br>
(II.) The "False Dawn"; Subhi Kazib, a transient Light on the Horizon<br>
about an hour before the Subhi sadik or True Dawn; a well-known<br>
Phenomenon in the East.<br>
(IV.) New Year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning with the Vernal Equinox, it must be<br>
remembered; and (howsoever the old Solar Year is practically<br>
superseded by the clumsy Lunar Year that dates from the Mohammedan<br>
Hijra) still commemorated by a Festival that is said to have been<br>
appointed by the very Jamshyd whom Omar so often talks of, and whose<br>
yearly Calendar he helped to rectify.<br>
"The sudden approach and rapid advance of the Spring," says Mr.<br>
Binning, "are very striking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Snow is well off the Ground,<br>
the Trees burst into Blossom, and the Flowers start from the Soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;At<br>
Naw Rooz (their New Year's Day) the Snow was lying in patches on the<br>
Hills and in the shaded Vallies, while the Fruit-trees in the Garden<br>
were budding beautifully, and green Plants and Flowers springing upon<br>
the Plains on every side--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'And on old Hyems' Chin and icy Crown<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;An odorous Chaplet of sweet Summer buds<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;Is, as in mockery, set--'--<br>
Among the Plants newly appear'd I recognized some Acquaintances I had<br>
not seen for many a Year: among these, two varieties of the Thistle; a<br>
coarse species of the Daisy, like the Horse-gowan; red and white<br>
clover; the Dock; the blue Cornflower; and that vulgar Herb the<br>
Dandelion rearing its yellow crest on the Banks of the Water-courses."<br>
The Nightingale was not yet heard, for the Rose was not yet blown: but<br>
an almost identical Blackbird and Woodpecker helped to make up<br>
something of a North-country Spring.<br>
"The White Hand of Moses."&nbsp;&nbsp;Exodus iv. 6; where Moses draws forth his<br>
Hand--not, according to the Persians, "leprous as Snow," but white, as<br>
our May-blossom in Spring perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to them also the Healing<br>
Power of Jesus resided in his Breath.<br>
(V.) Iram, planted by King Shaddad, and now sunk somewhere in the<br>
Sands of Arabia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamshyd's Seven-ring'd Cup was typical of the 7<br>
Heavens, 7 Planets, 7 Seas, &amp;c., and was a Divining Cup.<br>
(VI.) Pehlevi, the old Heroic Sanskrit of Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hafiz also speaks<br>
of the Nightingale's Pehlevi, which did not change with the People's.<br>
I am not sure if the fourth line refers to the Red Rose looking<br>
sickly, or to the Yellow Rose that ought to be Red; Red, White, and<br>
Yellow Roses all common in Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Southey in his Common-<br>
Place Book, quotes from some Spanish author about the Rose being White<br>
till 10 o'clock; "Rosa Perfecta" at 2; and "perfecta incarnada" at 5.<br>
(X.) Rustum, the "Hercules" of Persia, and Zal his Father, whose<br>
exploits are among the most celebrated in the Shahnama.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hatim Tai, a<br>
well-known type of Oriental Generosity.<br>
(XIII.) A Drum--beaten outside a Palace.<br>
(XIV.) That is, the Rose's Golden Centre.<br>
(XVIII.) Persepolis: call'd also Takht-i-Jam-shyd--THE THRONE OF<br>
JAMSHYD, "King Splendid," of the mythical Peshdadian Dynasty, and<br>
supposed (according to the Shah-nama) to have been founded and built<br>
by him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others refer it to the Work of the Genie King, Jan Ibn<br>
Jan--who also built the Pyramids--before the time of Adam.<br>
BAHRAM GUR.--Bahram of the Wild Ass--a Sassanian Sovereign--had also<br>
his Seven Castles (like the King of Bohemia!) each of a different<br>
Colour: each with a Royal Mistress within; each of whom tells him a<br>
Story, as told in one of the most famous Poems of Persia, written by<br>
Amir Khusraw: all these Sevens also figuring (according to Eastern<br>
Mysticism) the Seven Heavens; and perhaps the Book itself that Eighth,<br>
into which the mystical Seven transcend, and within which they<br>
revolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ruins of Three of those Towers are yet shown by the<br>
Peasantry; as also the Swamp in which Bahram sunk, like the Master of<br>
Ravenswood, while pursuing his Gur.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palace that to Heav'n his pillars threw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kings the forehead on his threshold drew--<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the solitary Ringdove there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Coo, coo, coo," she cried; and "Coo, coo, coo."<br>
[Included in Nicolas's edition as No. 350 of the Rubaiyat, and also in<br>
Mr. Whinfield's translation.]<br>
This Quatrain Mr. Binning found, among several of Hafiz and others,<br>
inscribed by some stray hand among the ruins of Persepolis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
Ringdove's ancient Pehlevi Coo, Coo, Coo, signifies also in Persian<br>
"Where? Where?&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?"&nbsp;&nbsp;In Attar's "Bird-parliament" she is reproved<br>
by the Leader of the Birds for sitting still, and for ever harping on<br>
that one note of lamentation for her lost Yusuf.<br>
Apropos of Omar's Red Roses in Stanza xix, I am reminded of an old<br>
English Superstition, that our Anemone Pulsatilla, or purple "Pasque<br>
Flower," (which grows plentifully about the Fleam Dyke, near<br>
Cambridge,) grows only where Danish Blood has been spilt.<br>
(XXI.) A thousand years to each Planet.<br>
(XXXI.) Saturn, Lord of the Seventh Heaven.<br>
(XXXII.) ME-AND-THEE: some dividual Existence or Personality distinct<br>
from the Whole.<br>
(XXXVII.) One of the Persian Poets--Attar, I think--has a pretty story<br>
about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;A thirsty Traveller dips his hand into a Spring of Water<br>
to drink from.&nbsp;&nbsp;By-and-by comes another who draws up and drinks from<br>
an earthen bowl, and then departs, leaving his Bowl behind him.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
first Traveller takes it up for another draught; but is surprised to<br>
find that the same Water which had tasted sweet from his own hand<br>
tastes bitter from the earthen Bowl.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a Voice--from Heaven, I<br>
think--tells him the clay from which the Bowl is made was once Man;<br>
and, into whatever shape renew'd, can never lose the bitter flavour of<br>
Mortality.<br>
(XXXIX.) The custom of throwing a little Wine on the ground before<br>
drinking still continues in Persia, and perhaps generally in the East.<br>
Mons. Nicolas considers it "un signe de liberalite, et en meme temps<br>
un avertissement que le buveur doit vider sa coupe jusqu'a la derniere<br>
goutte."&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not more likely an ancient Superstition; a Libation to<br>
propitiate Earth, or make her an Accomplice in the illicit Revel?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or,<br>
perhaps, to divert the Jealous Eye by some sacrifice of superfluity,<br>
as with the Ancients of the West?&nbsp;&nbsp;With Omar we see something more is<br>
signified; the precious Liquor is not lost, but sinks into the ground<br>
to refresh the dust of some poor Wine-worshipper foregone.<br>
Thus Hafiz, copying Omar in so many ways: "When thou drinkest Wine<br>
pour a draught on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore fear the Sin which brings to<br>
another Gain?"<br>
(XLIII.) According to one beautiful Oriental Legend, Azrael<br>
accomplishes his mission by holding to the nostril an Apple from the<br>
Tree of Life.<br>
This, and the two following Stanzas would have been withdrawn, as<br>
somewhat de trop, from the Text, but for advice which I least like to<br>
disregard.<br>
(LI.) From Mah to Mahi; from Fish to Moon.<br>
(LVI.) A Jest, of course, at his Studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;A curious mathematical<br>
Quatrain of Omar's has been pointed out to me; the more curious<br>
because almost exactly parallel'd by some Verses of Doctor Donne's,<br>
that are quoted in Izaak Walton's Lives!&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is Omar: "You and I are<br>
the image of a pair of compasses; though we have two heads (sc. our<br>
feet) we have one body; when we have fixed the centre for our circle,<br>
we bring our heads (sc. feet) together at the end."&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Donne:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we be two, we two are so<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stiff twin-compasses are two;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy Soul, the fixt foot, makes no show<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move, but does if the other do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And though thine in the centre sit,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when my other far does roam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine leans and hearkens after it,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rows erect as mine comes home.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such thou must be to me, who must<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the other foot obliquely run;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy firmness makes my circle just,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And me to end where I begun.<br>
(LIX.) The Seventy-two Religions supposed to divide the World,<br>
including Islamism, as some think: but others not.<br>
(LX.) Alluding to Sultan Mahmud's Conquest of India and its dark<br>
people.<br>
(LXVIII.) Fanusi khiyal, a Magic-lanthorn still used in India; the<br>
cylindrical Interior being painted with various Figures, and so<br>
lightly poised and ventilated as to revolve round the lighted Candle<br>
within.<br>
(LXX.) A very mysterious Line in the Original:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;O danad O danad O danad O--<br>
breaking off something like our Wood-pigeon's Note, which she is said<br>
to take up just where she left off.<br>
(LXXV.) Parwin and Mushtari--The Pleiads and Jupiter.<br>
(LXXXVII.) This Relation of Pot and Potter to Man and his Maker<br>
figures far and wide in the Literature of the World, from the time of<br>
the Hebrew Prophets to the present; when it may finally take the name<br>
of "Pot theism," by which Mr. Carlyle ridiculed Sterling's<br>
"Pantheism."&nbsp;&nbsp;My Sheikh, whose knowledge flows in from all quarters,<br>
writes to me--<br>
"Apropos of old Omar's Pots, did I ever tell you the sentence I found<br>
in 'Bishop Pearson on the Creed'?&nbsp;&nbsp;'Thus are we wholly at the disposal<br>
of His will, and our present and future condition framed and ordered<br>
by His free, but wise and just, decrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath not the potter power<br>
over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and<br>
another unto dishonour?&nbsp;&nbsp;(Rom. ix. 21.)&nbsp;&nbsp;And can that earth-artificer<br>
have a freer power over his brother potsherd (both being made of the<br>
same metal), than God hath over him, who, by the strange fecundity of<br>
His omnipotent power, first made the clay out of nothing, and then him<br>
out of that?'"<br>
And again--from a very different quarter--"I had to refer the other<br>
day to Aristophanes, and came by chance on a curious Speaking-pot<br>
story in the Vespae, which I had quite forgotten.<br>
[Greek text deleted from etext.]<br>
"The Pot calls a bystander to be a witness to his bad treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
woman says, 'If, by Proserpine, instead of all this 'testifying'<br>
(comp. Cuddie and his mother in 'Old Mortality!') you would buy<br>
yourself a rivet, it would show more sense in you!'&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scholiast<br>
explains echinus as [Greek phrase deleted from etext]."<br>
One more illustration for the oddity's sake from the "Autobiography of<br>
a Cornish Rector," by the late James Hamley Tregenna.&nbsp;&nbsp;1871.<br>
"There was one odd Fellow in our Company--he was so like a Figure in<br>
the 'Pilgrim's Progress' that Richard always called him the<br>
'ALLEGORY,' with a long white beard--a rare Appendage in those<br>
days--and a Face the colour of which seemed to have been baked in,<br>
like the Faces one used to see on Earthenware Jugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Country-<br>
dialect Earthenware is called 'Clome'; so the Boys of the Village used<br>
to shout out after him--'Go back to the Potter, Old Clomeface, and get<br>
baked over again.'&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 'Allegory,' though shrewd enough in most<br>
things, had the reputation of being 'saift-baked,' i.e., of weak<br>
intellect."<br>
(XC.) At the Close of the Fasting Month, Ramazan (which makes the<br>
Mussulman unhealthy and unamiable), the first Glimpse of the New Moon<br>
(who rules their division of the Year) is looked for with the utmost<br>
Anxiety, and hailed with Acclamation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is that the Porter's<br>
Knot maybe heard--toward the Cellar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Omar has elsewhere a pretty<br>
Quatrain about the same Moon--<br>
 "Be of Good Cheer--the sullen Month will die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a young Moon requite us by and by:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Look how the Old one meagre, bent, and wan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Age and Fast, is fainting from the Sky!"</td></tr></tbody></table>
