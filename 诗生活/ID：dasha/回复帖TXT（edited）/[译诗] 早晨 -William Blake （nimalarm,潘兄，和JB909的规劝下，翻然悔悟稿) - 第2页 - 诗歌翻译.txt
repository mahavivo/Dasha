好译，向伟大的太阳仙女致敬。In the vast cycles of life and death I inexorably hurl them down into destruction: these are the 

lowest of men, cruel and evil, whose soul is hate.  Reborn in a lower life, in darkness birth after 

birth, they come not to me, Arjuna; but they go down the path of hell.  Three are the gates to this 

hell, the death of the soul: the gate of lust, the gate of wrath, and the gate of greed.  Let a man 

shun all three.  When a man is free from these three doors of darkness, he does what is good for his 

soul, and then he enters the Path Supreme.  But the man who rejects the words of the Scriptures and 

follows the impulse of desire attains neither his perfection, nor joy, nor the Path Supreme. (Mascar

ó, pp 110-111)

Dasha注：The Bhagavad Gita，薄伽梵歌。the gate of wrath当作the gate of angry，估计the gate of wrath

是误读。

Lust, anger, and greed are the three gates of hell leading to the downfall (or bondage) of the 

individual. Therefore, one must (learn to) give up these three. (16.21) One who is liberated from 

these three gates of hell, O Arjun, does what is best and consequently attains the supreme abode. 

(16.22)
