Part One: Life

Epigram

THIS is my letter to the world,  
  That never wrote to me,—  
The simple news that Nature told,  
  With tender majesty.  
   
Her message is committed
  To hands I cannot see;  
For love of her, sweet countrymen,  
  Judge tenderly of me! 

-----------------------------------------
Part Two: Nature

II

WILL there really be a morning?  
Is there such a thing as day?  
Could I see it from the mountains  
If I were as tall as they?  
   
Has it feet like water-lilies?
Has it feathers like a bird?  
Is it brought from famous countries  
Of which I have never heard?  
   
Oh, some scholar! Oh, some sailor!  
Oh, some wise man from the skies!
Please to tell a little pilgrim  
Where the place called morning lies! 

-----------------------------------------
Part Five: The Single Hound

LXV

SUMMER begins to have the look,  
Peruser of enchanting Book  
Reluctantly, but sure, perceives—  
A gain upon the backward leaves.  
   
Autumn begins to be inferred
By millinery of the cloud,  
Or deeper color in the shawl  
That wraps the everlasting hill.  
   
The eye begins its avarice,  
A meditation chastens speech,
Some Dyer of a distant tree  
Resumes his gaudy industry.  
   
Conclusion is the course of all,  
Almost to be perennial,  
And then elude stability
Recalls to immortality. 


-----------------------------------------
Part One: Life

XCVI

MY life closed twice before its close;  
  It yet remains to see  
If Immortality unveil  
  A third event to me,  
   
So huge, so hopeless to conceive, 
  As these that twice befell.  
Parting is all we know of heaven,  
  And all we need of hell.
