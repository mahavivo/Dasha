对不起，Erich Fried的东西Dasha没有读过。

在www.amazon.de上查了一下，相当畅销。
译者马文韬，北京大学外国语学院德语系教授，2001年1月15日获奥地利共和国政府颁发的“杰出翻译奖”。
Erich Fried按照“德汉词典”和新华社的“德语人名译名手册”应该译作“埃里希·弗里德”。
附，Dasha通过Google查到的Erich Fried的一些诗的英译，仅供参考阅读：

  
1. What It Is
  
  
It is madness
  says reason
  It is what it is
  says love
  
  It is unhappiness
  says caution
  It is nothing but pain
  says fear
  It has no future
  says insight
  It is what it is
  says love
  
  It is ridiculous
  says pride
  It is foolish
  says caution
  It is impossible
  says experience
  It is what it is
  says love.

  
2. Bush with Heart-shaped Leaves
  
  
Warm summer rain:
  When a heavy drop falls
  the whole leaf quivers.
  So my heart quivers
  each time your name falls on it.
  

  
3. But
  

  At first I fell in love
  with the brightness of your eyes
  with your laugh
  with your joy in life
  
  Now I love your weeping too
  and your fear of life
  and the helplessness
  in your eyes
  
  But I will help you
  with your fear
  for my joy in life
  is still the brightness of your eyes
  

  
4. Without You
  
  
Not nothing
  without you
  but not the same
  
  Not nothing
  without you
  but perhaps less
  
  Not nothing
  but less
  and less
  
  Perhaps not nothing
  without you
  but not much more
  

  
5. Humorless
  
  
The boys
  throw
  in jest
  (with) stones
  at frogs
  
  The frogs
  die
  in earnest
  

  
6. An Attempt
  

  I have attempted
  - while working -
  to try
  thinking of my work
  and not of you
  
  And I am happy
  that the attempt
  did not succeed.
  

  
7. Cancellation
  
Being able to breathe out
  one's unhappiness
  
  breathe out deeply
  so that one can
  breathe in again
  
  And perhaps also being able to speak
  one's unhappiness
  in words
  in real words
  which are coherent
  and make sense
  and which one can
  understand oneself
  and which perhaps
  someone else can understand
  or could understand
  
  And being able to try
  
  That again would
  almost be
  happiness
  

  
8. Perhaps
  

  Remembering
  that is
  perhaps
  the most painful way
  of forgetting
  and perhaps
  the kindest way
  of easing
  this pain
