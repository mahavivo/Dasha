哪位老兄帮我译一下这个歌Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(on the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown)
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)

Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and publishes a gun)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bells blazing in scarlet battalion)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they’ve long ago forgotten)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine

嗨，梅兄，找张盗版《毕业生》的VCD或DVD就行了。汉语会失去其中的美。

斯卡波罗集市 (尽量保持原意,发挥了一点点,希望大家指正)Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
你要到斯卡波罗集市去吗
那里欧芹草,鼠尾草,迷迭香,百里香处处生长
代我问候住在那里的一个人吧
因为她曾经是我真挚的爱人

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(on the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on the snow crested brown)
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
让她为我做件麻纱衣衫
(在丛林深处大山这边)
那里欧芹草,鼠尾草,迷迭香,百里香处处芬芳
(在白雪覆盖的荒野找寻麻雀的影踪)
如果找不到缝合刺绣的痕迹
(大山之子的毛毯和床单)
那么她必定是我真挚的爱人
(沉睡不知响亮的号角)

Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and publishes a gun)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine
让她到辽阔平原找我
(大山的那边,树叶湿润晶莹)
那里欧芹草,鼠尾草,迷迭香,百里香处处迷茫
(闪闪泪光洗过坟墓)
咸水和海岸之间
(一个士兵擦亮钢枪)
那么她必定是我真挚的爱人

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bells blazing in scarlet battalion)
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they’ve long ago forgotten)
Then she’ll be a true love of mine
让她用皮鞘里的镰刀收割
(战争在咆哮,红色军营里战火燃烧)
那里欧芹草,鼠尾草,迷迭香,百里香处处金黄
(将军命令他们的士兵冲杀)
然后用石楠束成一捆
(为他们早已遗忘的事业而战)
那么她必定是我真挚的爱人
